## Theme - 404 (not found)

- 404 spell not found
  - magic system where you can only cast spell once than you forget it - Vancian Magic
- 404 this room/world/etc does not exist
  - you see the room/world/etc procgenning before your eyes and then the main gameplayloop starts, repeat
  - maybe lore wise use something like the [infinite impropability drive](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive)
